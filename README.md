# Krushkal Algorithm | MST

* Project created for finding Minimum spanning tree(MST) using Krushkal Algorithm. An example has been illustrated in example page.
* A MST or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected and undirected graph is a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree.
* Algorithm can be used for any number of nodes in a network. However, for simplicity dropdown menu given for number of node selection.
* For finding MST, select the number of nodes in your network, enter weights for each edge. Click Find MST button to get the output with results and netw
* In the output network, edges with red color showing the MST of the given network.
